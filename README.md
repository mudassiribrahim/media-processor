# media-processor
To build a Node.js backend system that can:

🔄 Accept media files (like .mp4, .txt, .mp3, .csv) from users,
⚙️ Process them chunk-by-chunk using streams and buffers,
🔌 Offload heavy or external processing (like metadata extraction) using child processes,
🧠 Run CPU-intensive tasks in worker threads,
🔀 Handle multiple requests at once using Node.js clustering,
🧾 Return meaningful processing results back to the client,
🚀 Built to be fast, efficient, and scalable — like a production-level service

🧭 Real-World Analogy:
Imagine you run an online video analysis platform, where users upload large videos.
Your backend needs to:
🔁 Accept and process huge files without crashing the server
🧠 Analyze content using CPU
🔌 Use tools like FFmpeg for encoding or info extraction
🧑‍🏭 Spread processing load across CPU cores
🛠 Return structured results (like video duration, size, type, etc.)
This project simulates that environment how real file-processing backends work at scale.

🧱 Key Features
Feature	What It Does	Tech Used
📤 File Upload	Accepts file from frontend (browser/postman)	Express + Multer
📦 Streaming	Reads large files chunk-by-chunk (non-blocking)	fs.createReadStream()
💾 Buffer Analysis	Works directly with binary memory chunks	Buffer.from(), .slice(), .toString()
🔌 External Processing	Runs a separate task to analyze/process file	child_process.spawn/exec/fork
🔁 Heavy CPU Work	Offloads deep analysis to worker thread	worker_threads
🚥 Concurrency	Handles many file uploads on multiple cores	cluster module
📊 Response Summary	Sends file stats back to user	JSON API response
